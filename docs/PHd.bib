Using income tax record data in combination with survey data is a potential approach to address the problem; we consider here the UK’s pioneering ‘SPI adjustment’ method that implements this idea. Since 1992, the principal income distribution series (reported annually in Households Below Average Income) has been based on household survey data in which the incomes of a small number of ‘very rich’ individuals are adjusted using information from ‘very rich’ individuals in personal income tax return data. We explain what the procedure involves, reveal the extent to which it addresses survey under-coverage of top incomes, and show how it affects estimates of overall income inequality. More generally, we assess whether the SPI adjustment is fit for purpose and consider whether variants of it could be employed by other countries.},

It was originally developed by Anders Hejlsberg at Borland, and was notable for its very fast compiling. Turbo Pascal, and the later but similar Turbo C, made Borland a leader in PC-based development tools.
For versions 6 and 7 (the last two versions), both a lower-priced Turbo Pascal and more expensive Borland Pascal were produced; Borland Pascal was oriented more toward professional software development, with more libraries and standard library source code. The name Borland Pascal is also used more generically for Borland's dialect of the language Pascal, significantly different from Standard Pascal.
Borland has released three old versions of Turbo Pascal free of charge because of their historical interest: the original Turbo Pascal (now known as 1.0), and versions 3.02 and 5.5 for DOS.},

	abstract = {Take-up of a social benefit is usually defined as receiving a benefit for which an individual or household is eligible. The take-up rate is the fraction of those eligible for a program who participate and receive a benefit or service. We survey estimates of take-up of social benefits around the world, discuss alternative theories of reasons for incomplete take-up, and survey the empirical evidence on the importance of different factors. We find a wide range of take-up rates around the world which follow some general patterns but are not easily explained. Theories of incomplete take-up include those involving low monetary or utility gains, stigma of receipt, monetary and nonmonetary costs of program participation, imperfect information, administrative barriers, and mismeasurement. The types of individuals who do and do not take up a program is argued to be determined by the joint distribution of gains and losses across those types, which ones face the largest administrative burden of participation and largest information deficits, and face more program operator error. There is a large body of evidence showing the importance of benefit gain and earnings losses from take-up but a smaller body of evidence on other factors, which shows that administrative barriers and costs, lack of information, and stigma all appear to be important for different programs. While there are no easy solutions to the problem of incomplete take-up, policies to at least lessen the problem are argued to be available, although generally not without increased government expenditure.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jval.2010.11.013},
	abstract = {Background
The application of conjoint analysis (including discrete-choice experiments and other multiattribute stated-preference methods) in health has increased rapidly over the past decade. A wider acceptance of these methods is limited by an absence of consensus-based methodological standards.
Objective
The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Good Research Practices for Conjoint Analysis Task Force was established to identify good research practices for conjoint-analysis applications in health.
Methods
The task force met regularly to identify the important steps in a conjoint analysis, to discuss good research practices for conjoint analysis, and to develop and refine the key criteria for identifying good research practices. ISPOR members contributed to this process through an extensive consultation process. A final consensus meeting was held to revise the article using these comments, and those of a number of international reviewers.
Results
Task force findings are presented as a 10-item checklist covering: 1) research question; 2) attributes and levels; 3) construction of tasks; 4) experimental design; 5) preference elicitation; 6) instrument design; 7) data-collection plan; 8) statistical analyses; 9) results and conclusions; and 10) study presentation. A primary question relating to each of the 10 items is posed, and three sub-questions examine finer issues within items.
Conclusions
Although the checklist should not be interpreted as endorsing any specific methodological approach to conjoint analysis, it can facilitate future training activities and discussions of good research practices for the application of conjoint-analysis methods in health care studies.},

	url = {https://ideas.repec.org/p/boc/usug10/02.html},
	abstract = {Although survey data are sometimes weighted by their selection weights, it is often preferable to use auxiliary information available on the whole population to improve estimation. Calibration weighting (Deville and Sarndal, 1992, Journal of the American Statistical Association 87: 376-382) is one of the most common methods of doing this. This method adjusts the selection weights so that known population totals for the auxiliary variables are reproduced exactly, while ensuring that the calibrated weights are as close as possible to the original sampling weight. The simplest example of calibration is poststratification. This is the special case where the auxiliary variable is a single categorical variable. General calibration extends this to deal with more than one auxiliary variable and allows the user to include both categorical and numerical variables. A typical example might occur in a population survey, where the selection weights could be calibrated to ensure that the sample weighted by the calibration weights has exactly the same distribution as the population on variables such as age, sex, and region. Many packages have routines for calibration. SAS has the macro CALMAR; GenStat has the procedure SVCALIBRATE; and R has the function calibrate. However, no such routine is publicly available in Stata. I will introduce a user-written Stata program for calibration and will also discuss a simple extension to show how it can incorporate a nonresponse correction. I will also briefly discuss the program's strengths and limitations when compared to rival packages.},

We explain what the procedure involves, reveal the extent to which it addresses survey under-coverage of top incomes, and show how it affects estimates of overall income inequality. More generally, we assess whether the SPI adjustment is fit for purpose and consider whether variants of it could be employed by other countries.},

A nonparametric analysis of consumer expenditure patterns suggests that Engel curves require quadratic terms in the logarithm of expenditure. While popular models of demand such as the Translog or the Almost Ideal Demand Systems do allow flexible price responses within a theoretically coherent structure, they have expenditure share Engel curves that are linear in the logarithm of total expenditure. We derive the complete class of integrable quadratic logarithmic expenditure share systems. A specification from this class is estimated on a large pooled data set of U.K. households. Models that fail to account for Engel curvature are found to generate important distortions in the patterns of welfare losses associated with a tax increase.},

	abstract = {Household surveys, one of the main innovations in social science 
research of the last century, are threatened by declining accuracy due 
to reduced cooperation of respondents. While many indicators of 
survey quality have steadily declined in recent decades, the literature 
has largely emphasized rising nonresponse rates rather than other 
potentially more important dimensions to the problem. We divide the 
problem into rising rates of nonresponse, imputation, and 
measurement error, documenting the rise in each of these threats to 
survey quality over the past three decades. A fundamental problem in 
assessing biases due to these problems in surveys is the lack of a 
benchmark or measure of truth, leading us to focus on the accuracy of 
the reporting of government transfers. We provide evidence from 
aggregate measures of transfer reporting as well as linked microdata. 
We discuss the relative importance of misreporting of program receipt 
and conditional amounts of benefits received, as well as some of the 
conjectured reasons for declining cooperation and for survey errors. 
We end by discussing ways to reduce the impact of the problem 
including the increased use of administrative data and the possibilities 
for combining administrative and survey data.},

	abstract = {This book is about the analysis of household survey data from developing countries and about how such data can be used to cast light on a range of policy issues. Much of the analysis works with household budget data, collected from income and expenditure surveys. Data from several different economies are used to illustrate the analysis, drawing examples of policy issues from economies as diverse as Cote d'Ivoire, India, Pakistan, South Africa, Taiwan, and Thailand. One of the aims of the book is to bring together the relevant statistical and econometric methods that are useful for building the bridge between data and policy. Chapter 1 describes those features of survey design that need to be understood in order to undertake appropriate analysis. Chapter 2 discusses the general econometric and statistical issues that arise when using survey data for estimation and inference. Chapter 3 discusses the use of survey data to measure welfare, poverty, and distribution. Chapter 4 discusses the use of household budget data to explore patterns of household demand. Chapter 5 is about price reform, its effects on equity and efficiency, and how to measure them. Chapter 6 is concerned with the role of household consumption and saving in economic development. The book also includes a code appendix, which gives code and programs using the STATA code, and serves as a template for the users own analysis.},

	doi = {10.1257/jep.24.1.225},
	abstract = {Engel curves describe how household expenditure on particular goods or services depends on household income. German statistician Ernst Engel (1821-1896) was the first to investigate this relationship systematically in an article published about 150 years ago. The best-known single result from the article is "Engel's law," which states that the poorer a family is, the larger the budget share it spends on nourishment. We revisit Engel's article, including its context and the mechanics of the argument. Because the article was completed a few decades before linear regression techniques were established and income effects were incorporated into standard consumer theory, Engel was forced to develop his own approach to analyzing household expenditure patterns. We find his work contains some interesting features in juxtaposition to both the modern and classical literature. For example, Engel's way of estimating the expenditure-income relationship resembles a data-fitting technique called the "regressogram" that is nonparametric -- in that no functional form is specified before the estimation. Moreover, Engel introduced a way of categorizing household expenditures in which expenditures on commodities that served the same purpose by satisfying the same underlying "want" were grouped together. This procedure enabled Engel to discuss the welfare implications of his results in terms of the Smithian notion that individual welfare is related to the satisfaction of wants. At the same time, he avoided making a priori assumptions about which specific goods were necessities, assumptions which were made by many classical economists like Adam Smith. Finally, we offer a few thoughts about some modern literature that builds on Engel's research.},

the development of large-scale, data-driven, discrete-event simulations. JAS-mine is specifically designed
for both agent-based and microsimulation modelling, anticipating a convergence between the two approaches.
An embedded relational database management system provides tools for sophisticated input-output communications
and data storage, allowing the power of relational databases to be used within an object-oriented framework.
The JAS-mine philosophy encourages the separation of distinct concepts, objects and functionalities of
the simulation model, and advocates and supports transparency, flexibility and modularity in model design.
For instance, JAS-mine allows to store the list of regressors and their estimated coefficients externally to code,
making it easy to change the specification of regression models used in the simulation and achieving a complete
parallelisation between the tasks of the econometricians and those of the programmers. Moreover, tools for
uncertainty analysis and search over the parameter space are also built in.},

	abstract = {The fuel demand literature provides a range of estimates of the long and short-run price and income elasticities of gasoline demand for different countries and states. These estimates can be very useful in predicting the overall impacts of policy approaches designed to reduce fuel consumption and to address concerns of carbon emissions or energy security. However, analysis of policy options based on elasticities that are homogenous across income groups provides no information about the relative distributional burden that may be faced by different sectors of the population. Different responses to the same change in price or income are likely to occur, dependent on both travel needs and income levels. This paper estimates gasoline demand elasticities for different income quintiles in the United States to test for heterogeneity in demand response. Group wise summary consumer expenditure data for 20 years is used to derive the elasticity estimates. The results show that the elasticities do vary across groups and follow a U-pattern from the lowest to the highest income quintile. The lowest income quintile is found to have the largest price elasticity. The lowest and the highest income quintiles appear to be statistically insensitive to any changes in income. The rebound effect also follows the U-pattern, with the highest rebound observed among the wealthiest households. Rural households appear to have lower price elasticity than households in urban areas.},

A practical application serves to highlight the usefulness of this algorithm in fiscal policy analysis at micro level.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the options available to researchers analysing multilevel (including longitudinal) data, with the aim of supporting good methodological decision-making. Given the confusion in the literature about the key properties of fixed and random effects (FE and RE) models, we present these models’ capabilities and limitations. We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a ‘hybrid’ model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions—notably random slopes—we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anticonservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.},

Alternative approaches to writing automated tests is to write all of the production code before starting on the test code or to write all of the test code before starting on the production code. With TDD, both are written together.
TDD is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming, begun in 1999, but more recently has created more general interest in its own right.
Programmers also apply the concept to improving and debugging legacy code developed with older techniques.},

JAS-mine is specifically designed for both agent-based and microsimulation modelling, anticipating a convergence between the two approaches. An embedded relational database management system provides tools for sophisticated input-output communications and data storage, allowing the power of relational databases to be used within an object-oriented framework. The JAS-mine philosophy encourages the separation of distinct concepts, objects and functionalities of the simulation model, and advocates and supports transparency, flexibility and modularity in model design. For instance, JAS-mine allows to store the list of regressors and their estimated coefficients externally to code, making it easy to change the specification of regression models used in the simulation and achieving a complete parallelisation between the tasks of the econometricians and those of the programmers. Moreover, tools for uncertainty analysis and search over the parameter space are also built in.},

Some research suggests that citizens are fiscally conservative, while other research shows that they punish governments for implementing fiscal consolidation. This begs the question of whether and how much citizens care about debt. We argue that debt is not a priority for citizens because reducing it involves spending and tax trade-offs. Using a split-sample experiment and a conjoint experiment in four European countries, we show that fiscal consolidation at the cost of spending cuts or taxes hikes is less popular than commonly assumed. Revenue-based consolidation is especially unpopular, but expenditure-based consolidation is also contested. Moreover, the public has clear fiscal policy priorities: People do not favour lower debt and taxes, but they support higher progressive taxes to pay for more government spending. The article furthers our understanding of public opinion on fiscal policies and the likely political consequences of austerity.},

In this paper, we show that the average marginal component effect (AMCE) constitutes an aggregation of individual-level preferences that is meaningful both theoretically and empirically. First, extending previous results to allow for arbitrary randomization distributions, we show how the AMCE represents a summary of voters’ multidimensional preferences that combines directionality and intensity according to a probabilistic generalization of the Borda rule. We demonstrate why incorporating both the directionality and intensity of multi-attribute preferences is essential for analyzing real-world elections, in which ceteris paribus comparisons almost never occur. Second, and in further empirical support of this point, we show how this aggregation translates directly into a primary quantity of interest to election scholars: the effect of a change in an attribute on a candidate’s or party’s expected vote share. These properties hold irrespective of the heterogeneity, strength, or interactivity of voters’ preferences and regardless of how votes are aggregated into seats. Finally, we propose, formalize, and evaluate the feasibility of using conjoint data to estimate alternative quantities of interest to electoral studies, including the effect of an attribute on the probability of winning.},

	abstract = {Welfare state reform in times of austerity is notoriously difficult because most citizens oppose retrenchment of social benefits. Governments, thus, tend to combine cutbacks with selective benefit expansions, thereby creating trade-offs: to secure new advantages, citizens must accept painful cutbacks. Prior research has been unable to assess the effectiveness of compensating components in restrictive welfare reforms. We provide novel evidence on feasible reform strategies by applying conjoint survey analysis to a highly realistic direct democratic setting of multidimensional welfare state reform. Drawing on an original survey of Swiss citizens’ attitudes toward comprehensive pension reform, we empirically demonstrate that built-in trade-offs strongly enhance the prospects of restrictive welfare reforms. Our findings indicate that agency matters: governments and policy makers can and must grant the right compensations to the relevant opposition groups to overcome institutional inertia.},
