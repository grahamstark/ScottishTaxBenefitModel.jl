## What?

Scotben is an open source microsimulation model tax-benefit of Scotland. Brand new - only brought to a useable state in the last fortnight. This is its first outing.

"""

# ╔═╡ ed1ca53b-0b7c-47e6-b4c8-9167731a49fb
md"""
## Why?

* Independence vs the Union: what would the budget of an independent Scotland budget look like?
* Relationship with rUK is complicated;
* Standard of Debate in Scotland not high!
* I was bored! This was my lockdown distraction. I'd been thinking about building this for several years, though.

"""

# ╔═╡ 067fd91d-77c6-436e-880b-45772b27d17a
md"""
## How?
* Conventional Tax Benefit Model - similar in outline to e.g. IFS Taxben, IPPR
* Highly modular design: bolt things together to make e.g. forecasting models, social care sims etc.
* Static model - no non-takeup, labour supply etc. But get the structure right and these things are much easier;
* [Test first development](https://testing.googleblog.com/2007/01/introducing-testing-on-toilet.html) principle - write unit tests and then just enough code to make them pass - the [model test suite](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/tree/master/test) is almost as big as the model itself.

## Julia

* [Julia](https://julialang.org) bridges the gap between statistics packages and high-level programming languages;
* you can do detailed, accurate programming with good support for [rich types](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/) (vital in a tax benefit model);
* but also use it for [data science/econometrics](https://juliastats.org/) (all the model regressions and graphics are native julia);
* *very* fast - [outpacing C/Fortran in some cases](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/);
* [Julia has a huge collection of contributed packages](https://juliahub.com) - including standard econometrics routines, data handling, graphics, differential equations and much else;
* This presentation is itself a Julia program, written using [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl). The model and its data are actually loaded directly in to this presentation and we'll interact with them very briefly in a minute.

## Structure

Divided into [packages](https://julialang.org/packages/) and [modules](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/modules/). A package is a high level generic chunk of code that can be downloaded and used independently. A module is a namespace - a small chunk of package code in which you can hide messy details from the rest of the program.

#### High Level generic packages:

* [Budget Constraints](https://github.com/grahamstark/BudgetConstraints.jl);
* [Data Weighting](https://github.com/grahamstark/SurveyDataWeighting.jl);
* [Poverty & Inequality](https://github.com/grahamstark/PovertyAndInequalityMeasures.jl).

#### The Model

[The Model is itself a package](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl). Intermally, it's broken down into a collection of semi-independent modules, for example: 

* [a household](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/blob/master/src/ModelHousehold.jl);
* [the fiscal system parameters](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/blob/master/src/STBParameters.jl);
* [means-tested benefits](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/blob/master/src/LegacyMeansTestedBenefits.jl);
* [income tax](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/blob/master/src/IncomeTaxCalculations.jl)

.. [and so on](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/tree/master/src)

Some of the modules (e.g. [Equivalence Scales](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/blob/master/src/EquivalenceScales.jl)) may eventually be moved out into generic packages.

## Data

* uses pooled (2015-2018) Scottish Households from [Family Resources Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/family-resources-survey--2) from the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/);
* Data from the [Scottish Household Survey](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-household-survey/) is [matched in](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/tree/master/matching). This allows much more accurate modelling of local taxes and (in the future) health, housing conditions;
* Since we have a [Calmar-like weighting system built-in](https://github.com/grahamstark/SurveyDataWeighting.jl), we can [weight to Scottish Population, Employment Levels, and so on](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/blob/master/src/Weighting.jl) very accurately and easily.

## The Model In Action

No point if people can't use it. I've no plans to build a full web UI. [Been there, done that, boring and rarely used](https://www.virtual-worlds.scot/demonstrations/). 

Instead, simple single-page UIs illustrating one point of interest. So far:

* [Budget Constraints](https://stb.virtual-worlds.scot/bcd/) - the weird, kinky world of the UK Tax Benefit System
* [A Simple Budget For Scotland](https://stb.virtual-worlds.scot/scotbudg/)

[These visualisations]() use [Dash](https://dash-julia.plotly.com/). 

For full detailed interactions, this Pluto notebook system and 'lab assistant' programs such as [Dr Watson](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/dev/).

## Known Problems

This is a very new model and full results are just emerging over the last 2 weeks. The test suite gives me confidence that the low-level calculations are accurate. However:

* Modelled [Inequality is too low](https://data.gov.scot/poverty/) compared to official figures - possibly related to 100% takeup
* Revenue estimates for Income Tax ~£1bn too high compared to [official forecasts](https://www.fiscalcommission.scot/publications/scotlands-economic-and-fiscal-forecasts-august-2021/):
  - possibly employers pension contributions;
  - or something to do with the pandemic.

## Next Steps

Scotben's clean interfaces and modular structure makes adding features easy. Julia also working as a statistics package makes adding behavioural features much easier.

* [Benefit non-takeup corrections](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/1954)  - this seems important for e.g. inequality estimates;
* long term projections (e.g. the [Scottish Growth Commission](https://www.sustainablegrowthcommission.scot/)- long term projection is technically quite easy with the components we have. [An earlier exercise is available](https://github.com/grahamstark/scottish_child_poverty_projections);
* consumption and spending data - either using estimated Engel Curves or matching in [Living Costs and Food Survey](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/livingcostsandfoodsurvey) (LCF) data.

And much else.
