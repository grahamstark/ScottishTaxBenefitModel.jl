Over the summer I built a microsimulation of Legal Aid for the [Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB)](https://slab.org.uk)- note on that to follow.

My SLAB contact asked a lot of good questions, especially about data. 

One thing that came up is how different capital data is in the [FRS](http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/frs/) and [Wealth and Assets Survey](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/doi/?id=2000056).

I don't really know why this is.

<!--more-->

The FRS docs state:

> Savings and investments: The data relating to savings and investments should be treated with caution. A high proportion of respondents do not know the interest received on their assets and therefore around one in ten cases are imputed. It is thought that there is some under- reporting of capital by respondents, in terms of both the actual values of the assets and the investment income. The FRS does not capture information on non-liquid assets. Therefore property, physical wealth and pensions accruing are not included in estimates of savings and investments. 
>[^FRS-1]

So it's not likely as accurate as WAS and only includes financial assets, but in practice it's *way* off.

## How Far Off?

This is a comparison on WAS Round 7 Net Financial Wealth with the recorded wealth from FRS.

FRS financial wealth summed `totcapb3` from the `benunit` record, aggregated to household level. The script for this is [wealth.jl in STBScratch repository](https://github.com/grahamstark/StbScratch/).

WAS is `hfinwntr7_sum`. 

Neither is uprated.

## FRS Financial Wealth 

```

Summary Stats:
Length:         16108
Missing Count:  0
Mean:           35_423.728518
Std. Deviation: 103429.012582
Minimum:        0.000000
1st Quartile:   0.000000
Median:         3_481.669613
3rd Quartile:   20000.000000
Maximum:        1109802.991556

```

## WAS Financial Wealth (positives only)

```

julia> summarystats( washf.financial_wealth )

Summary Stats:
Length:         14306
Missing Count:  0
Mean:           105_456.663263
Std. Deviation: 164508.676369
Minimum:        1.000000
1st Quartile:   7000.000000
Median:         36_130.500000
3rd Quartile:   128000.000000
Maximum:        996000.000000

```

So the FRS financial wealth Median is 1/10th the WAS median. 

### Techie Note

This script was my 1st experiment with [Tidier](), Julia's [R]() [Tidyverse]() clone. I'm impressed, though there's less call for this in Julia than in R since julia's loops are so efficient, so all the piping isn't needed in quite the same way.)

Tidier lets you do things like: 

```julia

fhw = @chain buf begin
    @group_by sernum
    @filter totcapb3 < 1_000_000
    @summarise hhwealth = sum(totcapb3)
end

washf = @chain wash begin
    @rename financial_wealth=hfinwntr7_sum
    @filter  financial_wealth > 0 && financial_wealth < 1_000_000 
end

```
