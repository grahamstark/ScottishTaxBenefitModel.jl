I've written [a short note on the model](/assets/scotben-summary-note.pdf) for a project I'm starting this week.

As an experiment, this was written with [typst](https://typst.app/) which I'm really impressed with - output looks very pretty and I like the fact that the markup system is a bit fussier and more precise than markdown, but still pretty easy to learn.

Source is [here](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/blob/master/docs/scotben-summary-note.typ).
