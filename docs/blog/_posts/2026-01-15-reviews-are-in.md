Here's the [Essex Review](/assets/scotben-essex-review.pdf) of Scotben. All very fair, I think.

I will indeed work on a takeup routine, though I think it's likely hard to get right. (On that, I found a [paper on takeup I actually like](https://extranet.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/docs/gurgand-marc/castellgurgandimberttochev2025.pdf)). Though I still have reservations about all the adjustments that are commonly make nowadays: 

* tax-benefit models are always going to be poor forecasting tools; 
* takeup corrections make individual level results much harder to interpret; and 
* most of the takeup literature seems pretty junky to me, confusing actual takeup decisions with modelling errors. (This new paper looks good in that regard).
