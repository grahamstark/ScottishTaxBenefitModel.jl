# ScottishTaxBenefitModel

## A  Microsimulation Model of the Scottish Fiscal System

This is **in development**, has just been moved from an earlier version, and so will likely break in all sorts of unpleasant ways.

```@autodocs
Modules = [
        # 
        ScottishTaxBenefitModel, 
        
       
         ] 
        Order   = [:function, :type]
```

Please bear with me, or better still, help.
