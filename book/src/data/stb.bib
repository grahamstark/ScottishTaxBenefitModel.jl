Using income tax record data in combination with survey data is a potential approach to address the problem; we consider here the UK’s pioneering ‘SPI adjustment’ method that implements this idea. Since 1992, the principal income distribution series (reported annually in Households Below Average Income) has been based on household survey data in which the incomes of a small number of ‘very rich’ individuals are adjusted using information from ‘very rich’ individuals in personal income tax return data. We explain what the procedure involves, reveal the extent to which it addresses survey under-coverage of top incomes, and show how it affects estimates of overall income inequality. More generally, we assess whether the SPI adjustment is fit for purpose and consider whether variants of it could be employed by other countries.},

It provides background materials for designing poverty reduction strategies. This book is intended for researchers and policy analysts involved in poverty research and policy making. The handbook began as a series of notes to support training courses on poverty analysis and gradually grew into a sixteen, chapter book. Now the Handbook consists of explanatory text with numerous examples, interspersed with multiple-choice questions (to ensure active learning) and combined with extensive practical exercises using stata statistical software. The handbook has been thoroughly tested. The World Bank Institute has used most of the chapters in training workshops in countries throughout the world, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Botswana, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malawi, Pakistan, the Philippines, Tanzania, and Thailand, as well as in distance courses with substantial numbers of participants from numerous countries in Asia (in 2002) and Africa (in 2003), and online asynchronous courses with more than 200 participants worldwide (in 2007 and 2008). The feedback from these courses has been very useful in helping us create a handbook that balances rigor with accessibility and practicality. The handbook has also been used in university courses related to poverty.},

	abstract = {Two decades after its original publication, The Analysis of Household Surveys is reissued with a new preface by its author, Sir Angus Deaton, recipient of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. This classic work remains relevant to anyone with a serious interest in using household survey data to shed light on policy issues.   
 
This book reviews the analysis of household survey data, including the construction of household surveys, the econometric tools useful for such analysis, and a range of problems in development policy for which this survey analysis can be applied. The author's approach remains close to the data, using transparent econometric and graphical techniques to present data in a way that can clearly inform policy and academic debates. 
 
Chapter 1 describes the features of survey design that need to be understood in order to undertake appropriate analysis. Chapter 2 discusses the general econometric and statistical issues that arise when using survey data for estimation and inference. Chapter 3 covers the use of survey data to measure welfare, poverty, and distribution. Chapter 4 focuses on the use of household budget data to explore patterns of household demand. Chapter 5 discusses price reform, its effects on equity and efficiency, and how to measure them. Chapter 6 addresses the role of household consumption and saving in economic development. The book includes an appendix providing code and programs using STATA, which can serve as a template for the users' own analysis.},

Julia is  designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature"  by practitioners of numerical computing: {\textbackslash}beginlist {\textbackslash}item  High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. {\textbackslash}item  One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. {\textbackslash}item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. {\textbackslash}endlist We introduce the  Julia programming language and its design---a  dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch,  a  technique from computer science, picks  the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that  one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

	abstract = {Engel curves describe how household expenditure on particular goods or services depends on household income. German statistician Ernst Engel (1821-1896) was the first to investigate this relationship systematically in an article published about 150 years ago. The best-known single result from the article is "Engel's law," which states that the poorer a family is, the larger the budget share it spends on nourishment. We revisit Engel's article, including its context and the mechanics of the argument. Because the article was completed a few decades before linear regression techniques were established and income effects were incorporated into standard consumer theory, Engel was forced to develop his own approach to analyzing household expenditure patterns. We find his work contains some interesting features in juxtaposition to both the modern and classical literature. For example, Engel's way of estimating the expenditure-income relationship resembles a data-fitting technique called the "regressogram" that is nonparametric -- in that no functional form is specified before the estimation. Moreover, Engel introduced a way of categorizing household expenditures in which expenditures on commodities that served the same purpose by satisfying the same underlying "want" were grouped together. This procedure enabled Engel to discuss the welfare implications of his results in terms of the Smithian notion that individual welfare is related to the satisfaction of wants. At the same time, he avoided making a priori assumptions about which specific goods were necessities, assumptions which were made by many classical economists like Adam Smith. Finally, we offer a few thoughts about some modern literature that builds on Engel's research.},

	abstract = {How cash transfers made to women are used has important implications for models of household behavior and for the design of social programs. In this paper, the authors use the randomized introduction of an unconditional cash transfer to poor women in rural Ecuador to analyze the effect of transfers on the food Engel curve. There are two main findings. First, the authors show that households randomly assigned to receive Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH) transfers have a significantly higher food share in expenditures than those that were randomly assigned to the control group. Second, they show that the rising food share among BDH beneficiaries is found among households that have both adult males and females, but not among households that only have adult females. Bargaining power between men and women is likely to be important in mixed-adult households, but not among female-only households, where there are no men to bargain with. Finally, the authors show that within mixed-adult households, program effects are only significant in households in which the initial bargaining capacity of women was likely to be weak. This pattern of results is consistent with an increase in the bargaining power of women in households that received BDH transfers.},

	abstract = {A discussion of problems in the popular debate about tax, with a special focus on the newspapers and television, is presented. For the most part, what people want to know about the tax system is fairly basic: how much better or worse off some change will make them and how much better or worse off it will make the population as a whole. The temptation in the media is to refer to some "typical" example families. Example families have their appeal, but it is unlikely that a few examples will give a good idea of the overall effect of any changes, and it is usually possible to prove virtually anything by choosing the right families. When politicians or newspapers make claims about the effects of a change in the tax system, the first questions that should be asked are: 1. What exactly are they comparing? 2. In particular, how do they allow for inflation? 3. Do they make selective use of examples? 4. What is happening to any extra revenue? 5. How often does the word "average" appear, and what does it refer to?},

Using income tax record data in combination with survey data is a potential approach to address the problem; we consider here the UK’s pioneering ‘SPI adjustment’ method that implements this idea. Since 1992, the principal income distribution series (reported annually in Households Below Average Income) has been based on household survey data in which the incomes of a small number of ‘very rich’ individuals are adjusted using information from ‘very rich’ individuals in personal income tax return data. We explain what the procedure involves, reveal the extent to which it addresses survey under-coverage of top incomes, and show how it affects estimates of overall income inequality. More generally, we assess whether the SPI adjustment is fit for purpose and consider whether variants of it could be employed by other countries.},

Examines what changes if a longer time horizon is used, and the focus is on redistribution over the life cycle or on intergenerational distribution. Finally, discusses public attitudes in the UK towards the redistributive role of government, and how these have changed over the last 20 years.},

	abstract = {The ‘rediscovery of poverty’ in mid-1960s prompted a wide-ranging debate over how the British government could best support low-paid workers and their families. Historians’ attention has largely focussed on the formation of the Child Poverty Action Group and its long campaign to persuade Harold Wilson and James Callaghan’s Labour governments to introduce a universal Child Benefit. The most radical response to the poverty problem, however, came from the Conservative government led by Edward Heath, which published plans to replace the whole system of personal tax allowances with reversible tax credits. This article examines the origins of the Heath government’s Tax Credit Scheme, which promised to both reduce the cost of tax administration and alleviate the ‘poverty trap’ created by means-tested benefits such as Family Income Supplement. It argues that the development of the Tax Credit Scheme in 1971-72 signalled the abandonment of the selectivity agenda with which the Conservatives had taken office in 1970, and so can be seen as one of Heath’s many ‘U-turns’. As the plans took shape, however, the cost of introducing the reforms on a no-losers basis became a source of growing concern within government. Treasury officials were relieved when Labour’s victory in the February 1974 election made it possible to jettison the scheme and retain the cumulative PAYE system.},

Micro-simulation allows the distinction between many types of individuals supplying labor in the economy and the variety of economic and demographic circumstances they face. From the standpoint of the usual framework for measuring labor supply responses, it is shown that married women appear to be the group that is most responsive to such reforms. However, this is also the group for which tax reform usually brings significant family income effects as well as marginal wage changes. The simulation results show that these income effects can go a long way in cancelling out labor supply increases from this group and stress the importance of analyzing tax reform in a household context. In general, labor supply estimates point to a positive uncompensated wage elasticity and to a negative income effect, as choice theory would suggest.},

We study the effect of this attrition on the unconditional distributions of several socioeconomic variables and on the estimates of several sets of regression coefficients. We provide a statistical framework for conducting tests for attrition bias that draws a sharp distinction between selection on unobservables and on observables and that shows that weighted least squares can generate consistent parameter estimates when selection is based on observables, even when they are endogenous. Our empirical analysis shows that attrition is highly selective and is concentrated among lower socioeconomic status individuals. We also show that attrition is concentrated among those with more unstable earnings, marriage, and migration histories. Nevertheless, we find that these variables explain very little of the attrition in the sample, and that the selection that occurs is moderated by regression-to-the-mean effects from selection on transitory components that fade over time. Consequently, despite the large amount of attrition, we find no strong evidence that attrition has seriously distorted the representativeness of the PSID through 1989, and considerable evidence that its cross-sectional representativeness has remained roughly intact.},

This paper documents attrition in the PSID through 2007 for a cohort of children, and investigates attrition bias in intergenerational models predicting adult health, education and earnings, including models based on sibling differences. Although attrition affects unconditional means, the weighted PSID generally maintains its representativeness along key dimensions in comparison to the National Health Interview Survey. Using PSID, sibling correlations in outcomes and father-son correlations in earnings are not significantly affected by attrition. Models of intergenerational links with covariates yield more mixed results with females showing few robust impacts of attrition and males showing potential attrition bias for education and earnings outcomes. For adult health outcomes conditional on child background, neither gender shows significant impacts of attrition for the age ranges and models considered here. Sibling models do not produce robustly higher attrition impacts than individual models.},

research of the last century, are threatened by declining accuracy due 
to reduced cooperation of respondents. While many indicators of 
survey quality have steadily declined in recent decades, the literature 
has largely emphasized rising nonresponse rates rather than other 
potentially more important dimensions to the problem. We divide the 
problem into rising rates of nonresponse, imputation, and 
measurement error, documenting the rise in each of these threats to 
survey quality over the past three decades. A fundamental problem in 
assessing biases due to these problems in surveys is the lack of a 
benchmark or measure of truth, leading us to focus on the accuracy of 
the reporting of government transfers. We provide evidence from 
aggregate measures of transfer reporting as well as linked microdata. 
We discuss the relative importance of misreporting of program receipt 
and conditional amounts of benefits received, as well as some of the 
conjectured reasons for declining cooperation and for survey errors. 
We end by discussing ways to reduce the impact of the problem 
including the increased use of administrative data and the possibilities 
for combining administrative and survey data.},

	abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers - often implicitly - assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these "standard subjects" are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species - frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior - hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

To achieve this goal, Sipilä’s government decided to launch a basic income experiment during its term. By experimenting with basic income, Sipilä’s government tried to find out whether the introduction of a basic income could make the social security system in Finland more inclusive and further increase the labour supply.  
 
The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and Kela - The Social Insurance Institution of Finland have agreed on the assessment of the basic income experiment. The assessment of the basic income experiment is carried out by Kela, together with the VATT Institute for Economic Research, the University of Turku, the University of Helsinki, the La-bour Institute for Economic Research, the Finnish Association for Mental Health and Tänk. The scientific director of the research project is Programme Director (SRC) Olli Kangas, from the University of Turku, and the administrative director is Research Professor Jaana Martikainen, from Kela.  
 
The Basic Income Experiment Evaluation Project studies the effects of basic income, utilizing both registry, survey and interview data. The research results of the subprojects will be reported in stages during the evaluation research project running from 2019 to 2020.  
 
This report is the first research publication presenting the effects of the basic income experiment in Finland. It includes a preliminary register-based statistical analysis of the employment effects of the experiment for 2017. An analysis based on survey data examines the impact of the experiment on the wellbeing of the basic income recipients},

@misc{chowdry_efficient_2010,
	title = {An efficient maintenance allowance?},
	url = {https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/5370},
	abstract = {The Government announced in the Spending Review 2010 that it would withdraw the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA), a payment of up to \&pound;30 a week to children from poorer families who remain in post-16 education, from September 2011. The Government defends its intention to scrap EMA - and replace it with a smaller payment - on the grounds that the EMA is expensive and fails to deliver enough bang for its buck. But what does the evidence on the effectiveness of the EMA show?
What impact has the EMA had?
Previous work by IFS researchers found that the EMA significantly increased participation rates in post-16 education among young adults who were eligible to receive it. In particular, it increased the proportion of eligible 16-year-olds staying in education from 65\% to 69\%, and increased the proportion of eligible 17-year-olds in education from 54\% to 61\%. Based on these impacts, and on estimates of the financial benefits of additional education taken from elsewhere in the economics literature, the study concluded that the costs of providing EMA were likely to be exceeded in the long run by the higher wages that its recipients would go on to enjoy in future.
This study was not able to examine the impact of the EMA on the likelihood of getting qualifications, but a subsequent report by IFS researchers found that in areas where EMA was available, students as a whole were around 2 percentage points more likely to reach the thresholds for Levels 2 and 3 of the National Qualifications Framework; they also had A Level grades around 4 points higher (on the UCAS tariff) on average.
Is the EMA an effective use of public money?
The Government argues that the impact generated by the EMA does not justify the \&pound;560 million spent on this policy in England. Underpinning this argument is a finding from some qualitative research. One of the questions asked those who were in receipt of EMA what they would do in its absence: only 12\% reported that they would not be in education. The Government infers from this that the EMA policy carries a 'deadweight' of 88\%, i.e. 88 out of every 100 students receiving EMA would still have been in education if EMA did not exist and are therefore being paid to do something they would have done anyway. The estimates from the IFS research reports above imply a level of deadweight that is consistent with this: 65 out of every 69 individuals aged 16 who are eligible for the EMA would have stayed in education without the payment. But does this mean that the money spent on EMA has been wasted?
If the purpose of EMA is to increase participation in education, then the higher the deadweight, the less valuable it will be. The question is: to what extent does the "wasted" spending on those whose behaviour was unaffected offset the beneficial effect of the spending on those whose behaviour was affected? The simple cost-benefit analysis mentioned above suggests that even taking into account the level of deadweight that was found, the costs of EMA are completely offset.
Furthermore, the key assumption behind the Government's methodology for calculating the deadweight is that the impact on participation is the only outcome that matters. But the EMA may have other benefits: those who receive EMA and would have stayed in education regardless of it might still benefit educationally through other channels: for example through better attendance, or more study time as a result of not having to take on a part-time job. Moreover, even if the EMA had no impact on educational outcomes it would still represent a transfer of resources to low-income households with children, which may in its own right represent a valuable policy objective.
Many public policies involve a high amount of deadweight. For example, the coalition Government announced in its June 2010 Budget the temporary relief of Employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) for new businesses located outside the South East and Eastern England, in order to stimulate private sector growth across the rest of the UK. The Treasury's costing of this policy implies that 96\% of the foregone revenue from this tax cut will go to employers who would have set up anyway (given the natural rate of business turnover) and that 4\% will go to employers who have set up in response to the incentives created by the policy. If the sole aim of the policy is stimulate new business then this would be regarded as 96\% deadweight. (But if the objective of the policy were to support new businesses in these regions regardless of whether or not they had started up anyway then the assumption underpinning the deadweight calculation would not be valid.)
Another example - more similar to the EMA - is the payment of Child Benefit to households with children over 16 who are in full-time education; EMA was initially conceived as a replacement for this. If the objective of this payment is to encourage 16-year-olds to stay in full-time education then it almost certainly has greater deadweight than EMA (it is also paid to higher income households, whose children are even more likely to remain in education anyway). But in the Spending Review the Government decided to protect this benefit: one might argue that a consistent approach would mean removing this as well as EMA.},

We look at a primary school programme introduced into English schools, the literacy hour, to work out whether changing the structure and content of teaching can enhance literacy skills, thus acting as a tool to alleviate problems of low literacy. Our results point to a significant impact of the literacy hour with there being around a 2–3 percentage point improvement in the reading and English skills of primary school children affected by the introduction of the policy. The literacy hour fares well when compared to other policies in terms of cost effectiveness. These findings are of strong significance when placed into the wider education debate about what works best in schools for improving pupil performance. The evidence reported here suggests that public policy aimed at changing the content and structure of teaching can significantly raise pupil achievement. The literacy hour therefore has practical implications for raising literacy standards in many countries.},

	title = {Paul {Johnson}: {Leavers} may not like economists but we are right about {Brexit}},
	shorttitle = {Paul {Johnson}},
	url = {https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8305},
	abstract = {While few can predict how Britain would fare long-term,\&nbsp;if we go it alone the immediate impact could be seismic.
The economics profession was, with some justification, condemned for failing to predict the financial crisis of 2008. It collectively was not paying enough attention to what was going on in financial markets, was too focused on its own unrealistic mathematical models, had forgotten the lessons of history. Where it was issuing warnings it was doing so in obscure journals and in terms that were not comprehensible to policy makers. All true, to some extent.
Today, though, virtually the entire profession is \&mdash; clearly and loudly \&mdash; ringing the alarm bells about the economic consequences of Brexit. In a recent poll by Ipsos MORI for the Observer, 90 per cent of economists said they expected Brexit to damage the economy. Just four per cent said it would be beneficial. That degree of unanimity on any poll of any group of people about just about anything is almost without precedent. A significant majority also said Brexit would risk a really big downturn. The overwhelming majority of the serious independent modelling work suggests Brexit would make us financially worse off, probably by quite a lot.
And believe me, right or wrong, they believe it. Many economists I\&rsquo;ve met in recent weeks have confided that they are quite literally losing sleep over this. There is a palpable fear that something really quite grim for the British economy could follow a Brexit. And before the cynics ask \&mdash; no, this is not because they (we) are in hock to Brussels for funding. We\&rsquo;re not. And in any case economists, like bankruptcy and insolvency specialists, tend to do fine when the economy goes wrong.
But another Ipsos MORI survey \&nbsp;suggests that two-thirds of Britons believe Brexit would not make them worse off. The warnings from economists appear not to be cutting much ice.
That might be to do with past failures \&mdash; of economists, not pollsters. It might be, as Michael Gove would have it, that we are all just fed up with experts. After all, it was the same economic experts who told us we should have joined the euro, right? Actually, no. Monetary union happened against the advice of much of the economics profession. It is a rewriting of history to suggest the reverse. The UK avoided an historic mistake in part because its decision not to join the euro was guided by the economic analysis commissioned and produced by the Treasury. This was led by the same man, Dave Ramsden, who has overseen the Treasury analysis of the economic consequences of Brexit. Same people, same organisation. In my view, it was the correct analysis on each occasion.\&nbsp;
That\&rsquo;s hardly a clincher for the current analysis being right but let\&rsquo;s at least put to bed the myth that all those suggesting Brexit would be costly supported joining the euro. By and large they did not.
So why do nearly all economists worry so much? The explanation lies in three words: uncertainty, investment and trade.\&nbsp;
In the short run a vote for Brexit would create uncertainty. In the immediate aftermath the pound, and probably the stock market, would dive, making us all poorer. Investment and consumption would fall, and the economy would suffer. Even one of the few pro-Brexit economists \&mdash; former Boris Johnson adviser Gerard Lyons \&mdash; accepts that short-term uncertainty would lead to reduced growth in the immediate future. \&nbsp;He describes it as being like the first part of a Nike swoosh \&mdash; short-term pain for long-term gain. There\&rsquo;s no doubt we\&rsquo;d suffer in the short term.
What about the long run? If there is one thing that economics has taught us over the past two centuries it is that free trade and openness is good for growth. In any scenario for a post-Brexit UK, trade with the rest of Europe \&mdash; by far our biggest trade partner \&mdash; would become more costly than it is at the moment. And it would take years to sort out trade agreements with the EU and with the rest of the world. That would slow economic growth.\&nbsp;
The UK would also become far less attractive to foreign investors seeking access to the single market. Trade and foreign investment are crucial drivers of growth and productivity, not just because of their direct effects but because both stimulate competition\&nbsp;and productivity right across the economy. That\&rsquo;s why the best evidence is absolutely, unequivocally clear: we are much better off now than we would have been had we never joined the EU. Again these are just facts.\&nbsp;
Of course we can\&rsquo;t be certain about the future. But I reckon that poll of economists gives us pretty good probabilities. Brexit would give us a 90 per cent chance of being worse off, five per cent chance of no change, five per cent chance of being better off. These are not good odds.\&nbsp;
But that is not the end of the story. These big decisions are rarely straightforward in the way that the remain and leave campaigns would have us believe. Being in the EU means that we have no control at all over immigration from the rest of the EU. Even if we avoided it,\&nbsp;it still means being part of a club that has made mistakes as costly as introducing the euro. It means sharing some sovereignty. It means being part of\&nbsp;the absurdly wasteful Common Agricultural Policy.
It is simply childish to suggest that there is no trade-off, that one side has all the answers. It is just untrue to say that we can control overall immigration if we stay in. It is equally untrue to say that we would have more funds to spend on the NHS if we came out \&mdash; we would have less.\&nbsp;
We are a rich country. The UK is either the fifth or ninth biggest economy in the world (depending on how you measure it). We could cope outside the EU. We can choose to accept a fall in our living standards to regain some sovereignty. I can\&rsquo;t tell you how to trade these things off, how to make this choice. I can tell you that Brexit would almost certainly make us, economically, poorer.\&nbsp;

Results from a survey of Israeli school‐teachers show that the influx of new computers increased teachers’ use of computer‐aided instruction (CAI).

	abstract = {This paper proposes a nonparametric method of estimating marginal treatment effects in heterogeneous populations. Building upon an insight of Heckman and Vytlacil, the conventional treatment effects model with heterogeneous effects is shown to imply that outcomes are a nonlinear function of participation probabilities. The degree of this nonlinearity, and hence the shape of the marginal response curve, can be estimated with series methods such as power series or splines. An illustration is provided for the returns to higher education in the U.K, indicating that marginal returns to higher education fall as the proportion of the population with higher education rises, thus providing evidence of heterogeneity in returns. Cet article propose une méthode non-paramétrique pour estimer l'effet de traitement marginal dans des populations hétérogènes. S'appuyant sur un aperçu de Heckman et Vytlacil, on montre que le modèle conventionnel des effets de traitement avec effets hétérogènes implique que les résultats sont une fonction non-linéaire des probabilités de participation. Le degré de cette non-linéarité et donc la forme de la courbe de réponse marginale peut être estimée par des méthodes de séries telles que les séries de Taylor ou des splines. On donne une illustration à l'aide de rendements de l'éducation au Royaume Uni qui montrent que les rendements marginaux de l'enseignement supérieur baissent lorsque la proportion de la population possédant une formation supérieure augmente, donnant ainsi une preuve de l'hétérogénéité des rendements.},

	abstract = {This book reviews quantitative methods and models of impact evaluation. The formal literature on impact evaluation methods and practices is large, with a few useful overviews. Yet there is a need to put the theory into practice in a hands-on fashion for practitioners. This book also details challenges and goals in other realms of evaluation, including monitoring and evaluation (M\&E), operational evaluation, and mixed-methods approaches combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. This book is organized as follows. Chapter two reviews the basic issues pertaining to an evaluation of an intervention to reach certain targets and goals. It distinguishes impact evaluation from related concepts such as M\&E, operational evaluation, qualitative versus quantitative evaluation, and ex-ante versus ex post impact evaluation. Chapter three focuses on the experimental design of an impact evaluation, discussing its strengths and shortcomings. Various non-experimental methods exist as well, each of which are discussed in turn through chapters four to seven. Chapter four examines matching methods, including the propensity score matching technique. Chapter five deal with double-difference methods in the context of panel data, which relax some of the assumptions on the potential sources of selection bias. Chapter six reviews the instrumental variable method, which further relaxes assumptions on self-selection. Chapter seven examines regression discontinuity and pipeline methods, which exploit the design of the program itself as potential sources of identification of program impacts. Specifically, chapter eight presents a discussion of how distributional impacts of programs can be measured, including new techniques related to quantile regression. Chapter nine discusses structural approaches to program evaluation, including economic models that can lay the groundwork for estimating direct and indirect effects of a program. Finally, chapter ten discusses the strengths and weaknesses of experimental and non-experimental methods and also highlights the usefulness of impact evaluation tools in policy making.},

	abstract = {Objective To model the overall and income specific effect of a 20\% tax on sugar sweetened drinks on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the UK., Design Econometric and comparative risk assessment modelling study., Setting United Kingdom., Population Adults aged 16 and over., Intervention A 20\% tax on sugar sweetened drinks., Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were the overall and income specific changes in the number and percentage of overweight (body mass index ≥25) and obese (≥30) adults in the UK following the implementation of the tax. Secondary outcomes were the effect by age group (16-29, 30-49, and ≥50 years) and by UK constituent country. The revenue generated from the tax and the income specific changes in weekly expenditure on drinks were also estimated., Results A 20\% tax on sugar sweetened drinks was estimated to reduce the number of obese adults in the UK by 1.3\% (95\% credible interval 0.8\% to 1.7\%) or 180 000 (110 000 to 247 000) people and the number who are overweight by 0.9\% (0.6\% to 1.1\%) or 285 000 (201 000 to 364 000) people. The predicted reductions in prevalence of obesity for income thirds 1 (lowest income), 2, and 3 (highest income) were 1.3\% (0.3\% to 2.0\%), 0.9\% (0.1\% to 1.6\%), and 2.1\% (1.3\% to 2.9\%). The effect on obesity declined with age. Predicted annual revenue was £276m (£272m to £279m), with estimated increases in total expenditure on drinks for income thirds 1, 2, and 3 of 2.1\% (1.4\% to 3.0\%), 1.7\% (1.2\% to 2.2\%), and 0.8\% (0.4\% to 1.2\%)., Conclusions A 20\% tax on sugar sweetened drinks would lead to a reduction in the prevalence of obesity in the UK of 1.3\% (around 180 000 people). The greatest effects may occur in young people, with no significant differences between income groups. Both effects warrant further exploration. Taxation of sugar sweetened drinks is a promising population measure to target population obesity, particularly among younger adults.},

	abstract = {Background Dietary sugar, especially in liquid form, increases risk of dental caries, adiposity, and type 2 diabetes. The United Kingdom Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) was announced in March 2016 and implemented in April 2018 and charges manufacturers and importers at £0.24 per litre for drinks with over 8 g sugar per 100 mL (high levy category), £0.18 per litre for drinks with 5 to 8 g sugar per 100 mL (low levy category), and no charge for drinks with less than 5 g sugar per 100 mL (no levy category). Fruit juices and milk-based drinks are exempt. We measured the impact of the SDIL on price, product size, number of soft drinks on the marketplace, and the proportion of drinks over the lower levy threshold of 5 g sugar per 100 mL. Methods and findings We analysed data on a total of 209,637 observations of soft drinks over 85 time points between September 2015 and February 2019, collected from the websites of the leading supermarkets in the UK. The data set was structured as a repeat cross-sectional study. We used controlled interrupted time series to assess the impact of the SDIL on changes in level and slope for the 4 outcome variables. Equivalent models were run for potentially levy-eligible drink categories (‘intervention’ drinks) and levy-exempt fruit juices and milk-based drinks (‘control’ drinks). Observed results were compared with counterfactual scenarios based on extrapolation of pre-SDIL trends. We found that in February 2019, the proportion of intervention drinks over the lower levy sugar threshold had fallen by 33.8 percentage points (95\% CI: 33.3–34.4, p {\textless} 0.001). The price of intervention drinks in the high levy category had risen by £0.075 (£0.037–0.115, p {\textless} 0.001) per litre—a 31\% pass through rate—whilst prices of intervention drinks in the low levy category and no levy category had fallen and risen by smaller amounts, respectively. Whilst the product size of branded high levy and low levy drinks barely changed after implementation of the SDIL (−7 mL [−23 to 11 mL] and 16 mL [6–27ml], respectively), there were large changes to product size of own-brand drinks with an increase of 172 mL (133–214 mL) for high levy drinks and a decrease of 141 mL (111–170 mL) for low levy drinks. The number of available drinks that were in the high levy category when the SDIL was announced was reduced by 3 (−6 to 12) by the implementation of the SDIL. Equivalent models for control drinks provided little evidence of impact of the SDIL. These results are not sales weighted, so do not give an account of how sugar consumption from drinks may have changed over the time period. Conclusions The results suggest that the SDIL incentivised many manufacturers to reduce sugar in soft drinks. Some of the cost of the levy to manufacturers and importers was passed on to consumers as higher prices but not always on targeted drinks. These changes could reduce population exposure to liquid sugars and associated health risks.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore the costs and benefits of hosting the Olympic Games. On the cost side, there are three major categories: general infrastructure such as transportation and housing to accommodate athletes and fans; specific sports infrastructure required for competition venues; and operational costs, including general administration as well as the opening and closing ceremony and security. 
Three major categories of benefits also exist: the short-run benefits of tourist spending during the Games; the long-run benefits or the "Olympic legacy" which might include improvements in infrastructure and increased trade, foreign investment, or tourism after the Games; and intangible benefits such as the "feel-good effect" or civic pride. Each of these costs and benefits will be addressed in turn, but the overwhelming conclusion is that in most cases the Olympics are a money-losing proposition for host cities; they result in positive net benefits only under very specific and unusual circumstances. Furthermore, the cost–benefit proposition is worse for cities in developing countries than for those in the industrialized world. 
In closing, we discuss why what looks like an increasingly poor investment decision on the part of cities still receives significant bidding interest and whether changes in the bidding process of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will improve outcomes for potential hosts.},
