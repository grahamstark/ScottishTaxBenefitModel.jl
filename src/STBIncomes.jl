module STBIncomes
#
# This module implements a list of incomes, roughly based on FRS incomes,
# implemented with constants and
# fixed length arrays. It's used by the calculation and results modules for
# fast computation. In the household module, incomes are modelled as a Dictionary.
# [Results.jl] has a routine to map between the two.
