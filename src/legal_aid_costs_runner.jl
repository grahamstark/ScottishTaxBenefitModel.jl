Include file for `Runner.jl` initialising what's needed for the new costs model to work. 
This is intended to be inserted into the `Runner` module. Doing it this way fixes some
nasty cross-dependences. 

!!! This code is not used in the live SLAB version, or included anymore in `Runner.jl`:

 - nasty cross-dependency (needs a run to start a run with the initialised data);
 - very slow, even with threading (num_people x 1 set per sample weight - so â‰ˆ 5.5m always);
 - existing code works reasonably well once a bug was fixed.

But keep around as it's nice code by my standards and could be useful someday.
Also .. sunk costs.
