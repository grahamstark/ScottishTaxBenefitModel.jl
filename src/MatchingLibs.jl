#
# A script to match records from 2019/19 to 2020/21 lcf to 2020 FRS
# strategy is to match to a bunch of characteristics, take the top 20 of those, and then
# match between those 20 on household income. 
# TODO
# - make this into a module and a bit more general-purpose;
# - write up, so why not just Engel curves?
