module Weighting
#
# This module has routines and target constants to re-weight our main dataset so it hits current or future totals for employment, 
# population by age and so on. See:
#
# Creedy, John. 2003. ‘Survey Reweighting for Tax Microsimulation Modelling’. Treasury Working Paper Series 03/17. 
# New Zealand Treasury. http://ideas.repec.org/p/nzt/nztwps/03-17.html.
# 
# for an overview of how this works, and the `SurveyDataWeighting` module for implementation details.
#
# The targets we currently weight for are:
#
# * Employment and Unemployment (from NOMIS)
# * Tenure Type (from Scotgov)
# * Household Type (from NRS)
# * Receipts of disability/caring benefits (Stat-Explore)
# * population in 5- year age bands
# * household totals by local authority.
#
# 82 targets in all, presently.
